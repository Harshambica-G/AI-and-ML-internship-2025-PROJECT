# AI-and-ML-internship-2025-PROJECT
This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to classify news articles as Fake or Real. It helps identify misinformation by analyzing the text content using natural language processing (NLP) and classical machine learning techniques.

The system preprocesses news text using NLP methods such as tokenization and stopword removal. It then transforms the text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. A machine learning model, trained on a labeled dataset of fake and real news articles, predicts the authenticity of new articles. The project also includes an interactive web interface that allows users to input news text and receive instant classification results.

The project is built with Python, utilizing libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning, Pandas for data manipulation, NLTK for text processing, and Streamlit for creating the user-friendly web application.

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing examples of both fake and real news. Extensive preprocessing ensures that the text data is clean and suitable for training.

The project consists of separate modules for data preprocessing, model training, and web deployment. This modular approach makes the code easy to maintain and extend.

Future plans include integrating advanced deep learning models like BERT for improved classification accuracy, deploying the app to cloud platforms for broader accessibility, and expanding the model to classify different types of misinformation beyond fake and real labels.
